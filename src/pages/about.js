       Quite a confusing name, and nothing to do with the city of Spain. 
        But this isn't true, but the establishment go way back in the past. 
        Since Barca is the italian translation of family name of the founder of this organisation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Back on the 18th of August 1811, the Netherlands was ruled by the French invader Napeleon. Who introduced the law, that every citizen needs to have a last name and be registered as a dutch citizen. 
        Most of the families based their name on Ancenstry names, geographical names, occupational names or propertynames. So my anchestors most like took their occupational name as a family name.
